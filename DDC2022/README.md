# Format
In each challenge folder, there is a handout folder and a deployment folder.
The `handout` folder is whats given to the players on ctfd.
The `deployment` folder includes what we used to host the challenge.
For some challenges solving is dependent on secrets in the `deployment` version which were not given to the player.

If you want to solve as "intended" vs a psuedo remote, just build and run the dockerfile in `deployment` (without looking at any of the files in there,) then connect to the local image :)
