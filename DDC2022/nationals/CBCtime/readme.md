Challenge name: `CBC Time!`

Estimated difficulty: easy-medium

Descryption
```
I don't trust any cloud storage providers so I made my own storage system, where i encrypt my data with military-grade AES encryption, and upload it to my website, where an intern then decrypts it and securely stores in over multiple locations!

Cryptogang said something about failed decryptions being vulnerable to a "padding oracle" or something, but i fixed that! And i'm so sure of the security that i'll even give you an encrypted flag!
