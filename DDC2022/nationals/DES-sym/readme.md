Descryption
```
I heard none of you broke my last hash preimage based authentication scheme! So why not try another one!

This time I'm using tried and tested DES encryption!
I heard some weird rumours about inverted keys giving inverted round keys, so to be extra sure I'll generate a completely new key every time!

I'm too proud of this function to run it on boring data, so make sure you send something interesting enough for it to be worth my time!

Good luck!
