Descryption
```
Cryptocurrency Bros keep losing their secret keys, but some smart cryptographers remembered a paper from the 70's about how you could split your keys into `N` "shares", such that any `k` of the shares let you recover the key. But less than `k` gives ZERO information about what the secret was!

We implemented this to help them with security, but now the crypto-bro's are forgetting their indexes! We made their indexes be determined by their names, so hopefully they can remember those now. Can you test it for us?
