RSA 2, Lasers Revenge

Description:
```
Information about our last attack leaked, and the developers of the device "fixed" it by removing CRT from their RSA signing!
Luckily they also removed the per-sig consistency checks, so you get to shine the laser for a lot longer now :)

Are you 1337 enough to recover the flag from plain old RSA signatures?
