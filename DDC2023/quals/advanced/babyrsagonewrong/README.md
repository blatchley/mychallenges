This challenge has some secret state stored only on the server, in the "secretdata" file. Its intended that this isn't available to the solver. 

Alternatively to solve locally just copy that file out but don't look at it too much.

To solve properly, go into /deployment and build/run the docker image, then connect to that when trying to solve ^^
