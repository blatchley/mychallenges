NOTE:

This is intended to be a sourceless web challenge. 
To play, go into /hosting and build/run the docker image.

The first step in in the intended solve is then to use automated tools to find the backup at 
`./supersecretbackup/backup.zip` where you can download the source code. Feel free to just pull this directly from the website once you've hosted it if you want to skip that step :p
