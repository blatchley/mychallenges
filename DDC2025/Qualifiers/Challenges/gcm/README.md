## Challenge name:
Authenticated Privilige 2, symmetric psyducks return!

## Docker setup
dockerfile in /hosting

## description
```
If all the math gets too much, there's always symmetric cryptography :)

In 2022 we made a nice beginner GCM challenge, but reading writeups like (https://rektedekte.github.io/CTF-writeups/ddc-qualifiers-2023/authenticated-privilege/) it seems like players found things like no AAD, and an endpoint to set repeated nonces?????

I've fixed all those flaws, and even temporarily removed the super-admin registraiton, so lets see what people can do now! \o/
