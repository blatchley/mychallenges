CTF challenges I've helped make :)


DDC 2022: The Aarhus University contributions to the danish cyber championships 2022 (individual competition for 15-20 and 21-25 year olds in denmark, part of the danish ECSC team qualification.) Primarily Cryptography with some misc added. 
Qualifiers were online (with any 6 challenges out of 18 solved giving access to regionals.) While regionals and nationals are both 10 hour one day contests, with top 50 from regionals in each age category going to nationals.

DDC 2023: The Aarhus University contributions to the danish cyber championships 2023 (individual competition for 15-25 year olds in denmark, part of the danish ECSC team qualification.) Primarily Cryptography with some misc added.
New addition this year was an advanced track for qualifiers, which unlocked once you qualified for regionals, and small prizes for top 10 finishers in quals :)

KalmarCTF: Helped with several of the crypto and rev challenges.
